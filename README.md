==============

My exam project for the module "Tool and plugin programming" ---

This is my choosen project to pass the exam. It will become some kind of "Super Mario"-Clone. The main aspect of this
project is the level editor which I work the most on. It will often change and I may end up with something completely
different then I had started with, because I don't have any kind of plan on what I want to do nor do I know how I want
to do so. 

This will be a HTML5,CSS3,JAVSCRIPT project. The Website will be build upon bootstrap (current v.3). On server side I'll
use Node.js with the express.js and socket.io modules. Mainly to send information between Client and Server.
